        <h3>Blog Post 1 Concept Design Build</h3>
        <small> Posted by Susan Sewe on 1st November 2023</small>
        <p>
            At Silchip we believe in providing comprehensive solutions for any engineering challenge or problem.
            We partner and help our clients conceptualise their ideas, we then create a workable design for each concept and finally build a long-lasting solution.

            Concept
            Concepts are abstract ideas we have in our heads. This is the first stage of our solutions development cycle. In this stage we endeavour to answer the following questions:
            1.	Who is this client and what is the nature of his business?
            2.	What is the challenge or problem?
            3.	Has the challenge been solved before?
            4.	Is it a re-occurring challenge?
            5.	What’s the solution from the client’s perspective?
            The end product of this stage is a clear definition of the problem/challenge and a mental image of how the solution will look like.

        <h3>Blog Post 2 Our Difference</h3>
        <small> Posted by Susan Sewe on 1st December 2023</small>
        <p>
            Silchip can offer you a better experience. We understand this type of inconvenience. We would have definitely carried this out in a more humane manner. First of all, you deserve to be notified prior to commencement of this type of work. Our method would have been to either carry out the works at night and by morning the area would have been reinstated or do it in sections that does not block your entry/exit while always maintaining a temporary way of accessibility to your premises.
